#### CIDRAM default signature files converted to htaccess format.

*Note: This htaccess version of CIDRAM's default signature files has been made available solely due to requests by some users that such a thing be made available. I don't use it personally, don't generally recommend its use, and don't intend to provide any support for it whatsoever. Seeing as it contains some 75,000+ entries, I anticipate that it'll most likely perform horribly for most users, slowing down servers to an unacceptable degree, and I anticipate that comparatively, the number of false positives encountered by using it will most likely be significantly higher than the number of false positives encountered by using its source (CIDRAM's default signature files, by way of a CIDRAM installation), seeing as its source provides a great deal of nuance (e.g., extended rules and conditions for whether to block/allow a request in the case of particular ranges, being able to selectively enable/disable specific kinds of signatures via CIDRAM's configuration, the ability to ignore signature sections, optionally expire signatures after a period of time and so on), and that nuance doesn't exist in this htaccess version of CIDRAM's default signature files. That all said, if you want to use it, you're welcome to do so, and here it is.*
