#### CIDRAM IPv4 signature files adapted for ZB-Block 0.5 (DEPRECATED).

*Note: ZB-Block 0.7 uses the standard/non-adapted versions of the signature files, [available at the main CIDRAM repository](https://github.com/CIDRAM/CIDRAM/tree/v3/vault/signatures). If using ZB-Block 0.5, use the "CIDRAM IPv4 signature files adapted for ZB-Block 0.5". If using ZB-Block 0.7 or newer, use the standard/non-adapted versions of the signature files.*

*As users have had more than 5 years now to upgrade from 0.5 to 0.7, these adapted signatures for 0.5 are deprecated, and will be removed in the near future.*
